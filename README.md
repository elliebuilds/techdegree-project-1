## Description

This is a random quote generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be run from your browser. 

Upon clicking the "Show Another Quote" button, a new randomly selected inspirational quote will load, and the background will change to a new randomly selected color. 

Additionally, a new quote and background color will automatically load every 25 seconds.
